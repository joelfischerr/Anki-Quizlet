_**NOTE** This has the certificate verification disabled which makes it work on macOS but also makes less secure. I won't take any responsibility for damage to caused anything by the use of this.

_**NOTE** fork of [Improved Quizlet to Anki Importer](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/590899480)_

This is a simple _Quizlet_ to _Anki_ importer. It has the following advantages over the alternatives:

* You only have to enter the URL to a _Quizlet_ deck
* Imports public decks and any associated pictures
* Has decent error handling (e.g. private deck)
* Doesn't make a bunch of new note types every time you import a deck
* Well documented code in case you want to modify or fork it yourself
